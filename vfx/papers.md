# Terminology from papers - NERFS

## novel view synthesis

## scene representation

## Camera poses

Angle of the camera when taking a photo

## depth supervision

Providing additional depth information to the ML model. Techniques include LIDAR, stereo matching, Structure from Motion [SfM] like COLMAP

## self-occlusion

When parts of a 3d objects are hidden by other parts of the same object

## RGB-D

RGB + Depth

## KL divergence

Kullback-Leibler divergence (relative entropy) statistical distance between two probability distributions

## Scene composition

Scene composition refers to the way objects and their relationships are arranged within a scene.

## Octree

Data structure used to represent 3D space. It divides space into smaller and smaller regions, known as voxels, until each voxel contains only a single object or data point.

## Signed Distance Function (SDF)


## Spherical harmonics

function defined on the surface of the sphere

## Trilinear interpolation

a method of multivariate interpolation on a 3D regular grid

## Interpolation

a type of estimation, a method of constructing (finding) new data points based on the range of a discrete set of known data points
